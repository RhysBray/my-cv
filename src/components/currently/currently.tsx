              Due to the nature of the work in dealing with sensitive police
              data there is a 6 month probationary period to ensure their
              standards are met. Within which I have been studying hard on the
              technologies used by the company on their production code in
              preparation for the Microsoft exams.

            <p>
              This has taken the form of reading a range of books whilst
              completing the tasks, practicing via katas and the creation of
              small projects set out by the company.
