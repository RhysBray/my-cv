            Fresh out of a 12-week intensive training course at _nology where
            the goal was to take my personal motivation to learn and turn it
            into leading industry talent in a short time-space.
          </li>
          <li>
            During the time on the course Iâ€™ve learnt a range of skills from
            semantic HTML5 all the way to building apps in React.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using these new skills I completed challenges and projects to
            finally culminate in a real project for a real client as a
            development team, taking the process from breaking down user stories
            to delivering the product to the owner that meets their standards.
